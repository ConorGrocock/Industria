This was our entry into the Ludum Dare game competition. The competition is 72 hours for teams, so please excuse some of the more questionable code choices, they were made while we were rushed and sleep deprived. 

Here is the game I made with 2 other people! As you will probably be able to tell, it’s our first time using Unity…

The game is tile based. During the game your villagers build themselves up, automatically having kids. The more villagers there are the more power that is used. Your aim is to gather coal (the black resource), placing a mine on it and to use that to produce enough power with the power plant. For these to actually gather coal/produce power you need to give your villagers jobs. To do this you click on one of their houses and assign them jobs, for example miner. If your villagers run out of power, you lose!

Please note: Each mine can only hold 5 people. To have more miners place down more mines!

The aim is to keep the bar at the bottom as full as possible. Your resources, population and power information is displayed at the top.

In your villager houses, the villagers automatically multiply. Assign them roles (for example miner) to make sure you always have enough to fuel the power plants.

You can only place power plants on grass, whereas mines can be placed on copper or coal ore:

If your power runs out, you lose!

The tools we have used are:
- Visual Studio 2017
- Unity
- Photoshop
- Piskel (Hence the pixel art!)
